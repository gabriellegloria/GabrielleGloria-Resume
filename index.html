        <p class="lead mb-4">To me, my passion in life is to make a progressive world for our future generations. In assisting the advertisement of products, I hope to popularize quality products and services that make life easier. Personally, I am very observant of the reaction of others, so I do have confidence in my abilities to capture the publicâ€™s eye. My designs are catered often to the clientâ€™s interest and I am able to make changes based on their opinion.
<br><br>

        I am an Undeclared student at the University of California, Riverside. At this institution, I have the opportunity to explore my interest as well as pursue my devotion to graphic design. My goal for my academic career is to graduate from Riversideâ€™s School of Public Policy and then apply to law school in California. Although It may seem as if I have not decided on what I would like to do in the future, for me it is the opposite. I choose to go into college as undeclare to gather knowledge from various spheres of knowledge to make the most of my college experience. Additionally, I decided to go to college as an undeclared student because it is more efficient to decide a major after finding interest. Rather than rushing into one after high school and realizing halfway in that it was not what I wanted to do. This being said I see myself as efficient in my use of classes for my first year as well as units. <br><br>

        As for my other passion for graphic design, I see myself as an up and coming. In adobe programs, I have 4+ years of expertise. I have mastered the process of conceptualization to delivery. Programs in my knowledge include Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom), Microsoft Office Suite, and web design. 

        For my skill set, I have various amounts of experience with diverse people. These skills are that I am multi-lingual, can program HTML as well as Java, can use the Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office Suite.
        
        Multilingual speakers routinely strengthen complementary workplace skills while using their language talents on the job -- such as expanded vocabularies, better problem-solving skills, listening skills, and interpersonal skills. With ease, I am sociable and precise in communication with clientele
        Both are a form of programming language that makes things whether its web pages on the internet or just something easy to write or compile. So it can be said that it is because of HTML and Java experience as a worker I am able to branch out creative mediums.
        In the digital world, communicating information in a manner that captures the attention of the viewer is paramount to your online marketing success. The ability to edit, manipulate, create and shape memorable images puts your brand on the radar and creates valuable leadership opportunities. 
        Microsoft is used by so many businesses, the skills you have working on the software are immediately transferrable to new jobs and companies. My knowledge in this program is applicable to jobs that require computer work.
